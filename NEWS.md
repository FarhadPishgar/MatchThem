## What's New

### Version 1.0.1

This is an update to improve documentation and to fix minor bugs.

### Version 1.0.0

This is an update to improve documentation and to add several new features: 1. `mimira` and `mimipo` objects (the output of `with()` and `pool()`, respectively) now inherit from the `mice` classes `mira` and `mipo`. This means `mice` methods work with these objects. 2. `coxph()` when used with `with()` now correctly uses the robust standard errors. 3. A `cluster` argument has been added to `with.mimids()` to control whether cluster-robust standard errors should be used to account for pair membership when the model is a `svyglm()`-type model from the `survey` package. The default is to include pair membership when present and there are 20 or more unique subclasses (i.e., pairs). This works by supplying the pair membership variable (`subclass`) to the `ids` argument of `svydesign()`. 4. `cbind()` methods have been exported and documented. 5. `mimids` and `wimids` objects are now much smaller, now containing only the supplied `mids` object and the `matchit()` or `weightit()` outputs. and 6. Added `trim()` to trim estimated weights. This relies on `WeightIt::trim()` and uses the same syntax (thanks [Nicolas](https://twitter.com/n_hueb)!). 

### Version 0.9.3

This is an update to fix few bugs.

### Version 0.9.2

This is an update to change the definition of the `complete()` function to evade name clashes with the [`tidyr`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidyr) package.

### Version 0.9.1

This is an update to improve documentation and to fix minor bugs.

### Version 0.9.0

This is an update to improve documentation and to implement compatibility for robust estimation of standard errors (compatibility with the `svyglm()` and `svycoxph()`, from the [`survey`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=survey) package, to be used as expressions within the `with()` function) and for new matching and weighting methods (e.g. the `full`, `genetic`, and `cem` matching methods as well as `ebal` and `optweight` weighting methods). Moreover, `complete()` function is included in the package to replace the `matchthem.data()` and `weightthem.data()`.

### Version 0.8.2

This is a spit and polish update to improve documentation and to fix minor bugs.

### Version 0.8.1

This is the first release of the [`MatchThem`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=MatchThem) package both on the [Github](https://github.com/FarhadPishgar/MatchThem) and the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=MatchThem).
