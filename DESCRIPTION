Package: MatchThem
Title: Matching and Weighting Multiply Imputed Datasets
Description: Provides the necessary tools for the pre-processing technique of matching and weighting in multiply imputed datasets in order to control for effects of confounders and to reduce the degree of the model dependence on certain modeling assumptions in studying the causal associations between an exposure and an outcome. This package includes functions to perform matching within or across the imputed datasets using several matching methods (including the exact, nearest neighbor, full, genetic, and coarsened exact matching methods), to perform weighting in the multiply imputed datasets using several weighting methods (including inverse probability, generalized boosted modeling, and covariate balancing propensity score weighting), to estimate the causal effect estimate in each matched or weighted datasets using parametric or non-parametric statistical models, and to pool the obtained estimates from these models according to Rubin’s rules. Please see the package repository <https://github.com/FarhadPishgar/MatchThem> for details.
