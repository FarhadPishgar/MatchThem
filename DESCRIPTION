Package: MatchThem
Title: Matching and Weighting Multiply Imputed Datasets
Description: Provides the necessary tools for the pre-processing techniques of matching and weighting multiply imputed datasets to control for effects of confounders and to reduce the degree of dependence on certain modeling assumptions in studying the causal associations between an exposure and an outcome. This package includes functions to perform matching within and across the multiply imputed datasets using several matching methods, to estimate weights of units in the imputed datasets using several weighting methods, to calculate the causal effect estimate in each matched or weighted dataset using parametric or non-parametric statistical models, and to pool the obtained estimates from these models according to Rubin's rules (please see <https://github.com/FarhadPishgar/MatchThem> for details).
